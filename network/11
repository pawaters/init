the command traceroute gives us the IP address and name of the device that make the link with the outside world: it is our local IP address (aka private address), on the first line.
Second IP address is the NAT server, which maps our IP address to another by modifying network information of the packets.
The third IP address is our public IP, our IP address assigned to our network router by our internet provider.
To check that, we can use traceroute of different websites and see how these 3 first IP addresses dont change.
